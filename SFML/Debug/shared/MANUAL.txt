Application Manual

Application does not take any parameters.

As interface is clear enough it's function's descriptions will be skipped.

Game rules.
0.Blue==player1 on the left.
0.Red==player2 on the right.
1.The goal is to reach and cross last row of opponent's side.

n>1 and is amount of units in clicked row.
6.Split down button V if possible splits units in 1/n ratio where 
n>1 and is amount of units in clicked row.
7.Battle button X resolves battle by simple force calculation
of a row += +-1 and columns:attacker, defender, defenders back.
Only attacking and defending units in chosen row are affected by death.
8.A unit may be killed in a battle if it's power will be 1 or less.

There are no clear hints or ideas how to win the game facing any opponent.
The game is supposed to be long and take more than 100 turns.

There is config file that must contain all the lines but values may differ,
and may be changed by the user to adjust the images and make some changes in gameplay.
Values are not checked before loading so any irrational input (more than int) 
may cause unstable execution of application. It is possible then to force the 
application to break.
